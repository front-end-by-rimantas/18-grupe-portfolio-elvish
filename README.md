## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out our Baltic Institute of Technology front-end course assigment!

The main challenge of this assigment was to  to improve our skills in a real-life workflow, as well as,
improve our communication skills, team work and get hands-on experience using GitHub platform!

**In order to complete this assigment we used HTML CSS and JavaScript and built everything from scratch**


## About the task

Our task was to build out a project form a scratch, while following given design template/example.


## Project features

* Responsive design
* Repetitive content is generated/rendered;
* Multi-page
* No AJAX


## Building our project

We tried to use structured workflow in order to keep our code clean and easy to read, as well as, we tried to employ workflow used in real-life

## Style

While following given design template we had to use our best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` or `margin`.

This meant that in order to finish our project we had to train our eyes to perceive differences in spacings,colors and sizes.

Below is a process and workflow that we tried to follow.
